Details
For this transaction I received funding from the website, [https://bitcoinfaucet.uo1.net/]. This gave me inital funding into my wallet. The software tools I used to receive funding was Bitcoin Core - Qt. In order to then redeem the funding that was sent, I decided to send bitcoin back to the faucet. This is requested from the faucets website. For both send and receive I had to generate a transaction with Bitcoin Core - Qt that was/is viewable from mempool space.
